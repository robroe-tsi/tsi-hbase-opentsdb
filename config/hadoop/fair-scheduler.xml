<!--
  This is a sample configuration file for the Fair Scheduler. For details
  on the options, please refer to the fair scheduler documentation at
  http://hadoop.apache.org/core/docs/r0.21.0/fair_scheduler.html.

  To create your own configuration, copy this file to conf/fair-scheduler.xml
  and add the following property in mapred-site.xml to point Hadoop to the
  file, replacing [HADOOP_HOME] with the path to your installation directory:
    <property>
      <name>mapred.fairscheduler.allocation.file</name>
      <value>[HADOOP_HOME]/conf/fair-scheduler.xml</value>
    </property>

  Note that all the parameters in the configuration file below are optional,
  including the parameters inside <pool> and <user> elements. It is only
  necessary to set the ones you want to differ from the defaults.
-->

<allocations>
  <pool name="production">
    <schedulingMode>FAIR</schedulingMode>
    <weight>1</weight>
    <minShare>2</minShare>
  </pool>
  <pool name="test">
    <schedulingMode>FIFO</schedulingMode>
    <weight>2</weight>
    <minShare>3</minShare>
  </pool>
</allocations>
